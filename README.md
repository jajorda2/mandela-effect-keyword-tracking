## Analysis and notes
In late 2016, there is a sharp uptick in searches for "Mandela Effect".

Between 2015-2016, there is a sharp uptick in searches for all three instances of "Berenstein/stain/Bernstein" Bears with another uptick in late 2016.

"Shazaam/Kazaam/Sinbad/Genie" keywords searches follow the same lines as "Mandela Effect".

The outlier in the data is that there was a sharp uptick in searches for "Sinbad" in early 2007. This is likely due to the 2007 hoax that the comedian Sinbad had died https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sinbad-death-hoax/.

**Newly Added**
"no i am your father vs. luke i am your father"
This is interesting because it shows a vast worldwide preference for "Luke, I am your father".

## So What Does This Tell Us?
Not much, really, other than that the "Berenstein/Stain/Bernstein" keyword searches pre-date searches for "Mandela Effect". I am curious about this.
